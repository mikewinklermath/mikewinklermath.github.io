# Welcome to mikematics

Hello and welcome to my private math pages. My name is Mike Winkler, also known as mikematics. I am a mathematician and live on a horse farm on the German North Sea coast. My work is mostly in the areas of number theory, combinatorics and discrete geometry, including graph theory. On this website I present some of my ideas, conjectures and proofs on selected mathematical topics from my private research, which I do entirely non-commercially in my spare time. When a problem grabs me, I work on it for many years. My favorite topics are the 3x + 1 problem, regular matchstick graphs, nonperiodic tilings and Heesch’s problem. Besides math, I love horses and cycling, play the piano and guitar, swim and paint occasionally.

## Have fun reading and exploring this website.
